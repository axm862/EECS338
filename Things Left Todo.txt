1) Create test for theoretical data from book and online, and screenshot results to use in slides later
2) Create tests for posix-rt.c, by first creating a long running thread (sorting algo like bubble?), and
   create shorter running threads (possibly shubert, maybe something else) 
3) Keep track of run times for posix-rt.c, start times and end times for each thread if possible using an array
   for time. Each thread adds to the array for a final output later.
4) If we can't add times to array and shit gets complicated, lets just find the overall run time for the whole 
   program and output that. 
5) Duplicate the program and change the scheudling algorithm to the other one 
6) Make a output file containing runtimes, run the programs like ~5 times and we can average it all just to make 
   sure
7) Run on HPCC just to test if we have time, its OK if we don't
8) Create slides using data and notes from OneNote
